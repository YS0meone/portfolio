Even with optimization the time complexity is still O(n<sup>2</sup>) which is obviously not good enough. One of the common mindset I would love to use when dealing with array is to think of if we know the solution to part of the array how would that help us if a new element is added to that array.

Iterating through all documents takes <code>O(n)</code> time. We would use inverse index instead. </p> <p>inverse index</p> <p>Inverse index maps each term to all of the documents that has it.

Besides the primes part this is similar to a very classic dp problem: Coin change. Basically, after you have created the array of all primes that smaller the target amount. The question turned into coin change. The main idea of coin change is to think in terms of optimal solution when we are looking at a subset of coins. We create a dp array where <code>dp[i]</code> represents the optimal solution given the current set of coins. When there is a new coin added into the coins set. For <code>i</code> that is strictly smaller than the coin denomination <code>k</code>, <code>dp[0] to dp[k-1]</code> is already an optimal solution considering the new subset of coins. For <code>i</code> belongs to <code>k</code> to <code>n-1</code> we only think of whether <code>dp[i]</code> would be updated given the new coin set. i.e. if <code>dp[i - coin] + 1</code> would be smaller than the original <code>dp[i]</code>.  As suggested earlier, <code>dp[i - coin]</code> would always represent the minimum coin needed for sum <code>i - coin</code> for the new coin set. So after we incorporating all of the coin types into consideration, <code>dp[target]</code> would represent the answer.</p> <p>However, this question tested another concept: Sieve of Erathosthenes which is an algorithm that generates primes in linear time. The main idea is as following: Each composite number would be a multiple of some prime numbers that is strictly smaller than it. If we know all of the prime number that is smaller than a particular number and it is not a multiple of any of them. Then this number is definitely a prime number. Here is the key: we don't check all prime numbers that is smaller than the current candidate. Instead, we rule out the multiples of a prime number once we find one. Thus, each number would only gets checked once -- linear time complexity.</p>"},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-16/#big-o-analysis_1","title":"\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Big O analysis","text":"<p>Assume the target sum is <code>n</code> and we have <code>m</code> primes.</p> <ul> <li>Time Complexity: O(n * m)</li> <li>Space Complexity: O(n)</li> </ul> <p>Since we use a dp array of size n and iterate the whole array for each prime.</p>"},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-16/#implementation-takeaways_1","title":"\ud83d\udeeb Implementation takeaways:","text":"<ul> <li>Understand Sieve of Erathothenes</li> <li>Know how to solve coin change problem both bottom up and top down</li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-16/#resources-that-requires-further-study","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Resources that Requires Further Study:","text":"<ul> <li>Kilo Code </li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-17/","title":"July 17, 2025 - AI Engineer RAG","text":""},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-17/#daily-goals","title":"\ud83c\udfaf Daily Goals","text":"<ul> <li> Review Anki Deck</li> <li> Lumosity training</li> <li> Finished AI Engineering RAG Chapter</li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-17/#what-i-learned","title":"\ud83d\udcdd What I learned:","text":""},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-17/#ai-engineer-book","title":"AI Engineer Book","text":""},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-17/#the-comparison-between-term-based-retrieval-and-embedding-based-retrieval","title":"The comparison between term-based retrieval and embedding-based retrieval","text":""},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-17/#metrics-for-evaluation","title":"Metrics for evaluation","text":"<p>For retrieved documents only - Context Precision: The percentage of relevant documents among all retrieved ones - Context Recall: The percentage of retrieved documents among all relevant ones</p> <p>Document ranking</p> <p>This expects the most important documents should be retrieved first</p> <ul> <li>NDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain)</li> <li>MAP (Mean Average Precision)</li> <li>MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)</li> </ul> <p>Embedding</p> <ul> <li>MTEB</li> </ul> <p>We should also evaluate the retriever with the model as a whole.

The trade-off is if the function name or parameter changes, you have to update the examples and prompt as well. Also, your planner won't work on different APIs. Even worse, if you fine-tuned your model for these tools, you need to fine-tune it again for new functions. In general, it would be better to tell the models to generate plans in natural languages.

Parallel control workflow can optimize the process of getting the price of each product by creating subtasks or subagent to retrieve the price concurrently. Usually, you can apply this pattern when you need to first fetch a bunch of result and perform some action on each of them.

The first question is actually quite easy. As we are doing backtracking, if the current combination is already larger than the target, we should prune it. The second one is a bit more tricky. The duplication would only happen if there are duplicate candidates. For example, <code>candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8</code>. The answer <code>[1, 7], [7,1]</code> would be duplicates in the return result. A good way to eliminate duplication is by sorting. Here if we sort the candidates before the backtracking, the returned answer would also be in sort. Now, we can think of when a duplication would happen. Should we avoid all duplicate candidates? Of course not, in the previous example, <code>[1, 1, 6]</code> would be a valid answer. The key is avoid duplication that happens on the same level of the state-space tree. <code>[1, 1, 6]</code> is not a problem since the first <code>1</code> has the depth of <code>1</code> in state-space tree. While <code>[1, 7]</code> could cause duplication since after we travese through all possible combination that starts with <code>[1, ...]</code> and backtrack, we hit another <code>1</code>.

Here is the pseudo code to do that:</p> <pre><code>temp_max = max(curr, max(max_so_far * curr, min_so_far * curr))\nmin_so_far = min(curr, min(max_so_far * curr, min_so_far * curr))\nmax_so_far = temp_max\n</code></pre> <p>This code actually takes care of all possible situation for both positive, negative and 0 all at once. </p>"},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-26/#complexity-analysis_1","title":"Complexity Analysis","text":"<p>Assume there are <code>n</code> numebrs in the <code>nums</code> array</p> <ul> <li>Time Complexity: O(n)</li> <li>Space Complexity: O(1)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-26/#resources-that-requires-further-study","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Resources that Requires Further Study","text":"<ul> <li>Saas AI Governance</li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-27/","title":"July 27, 2025 - Daily Drill","text":""},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-27/#daily-goals","title":"\ud83c\udfaf Daily Goals","text":"<ul> <li> Review Anki Deck</li> <li> Lumosity training</li> <li> Leetcode</li> <li> Developing laplace</li> <li> Langchain Learning</li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-27/#what-i-learned","title":"\ud83d\udcdd What I learned:","text":""},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-27/#trie","title":"Trie","text":""},{"location":"learn/2025/07-july/2025-07-27/#definition","title":"Definition","text":"<p>Trie is a special form a Nary tree that stores strings.

With AI, we can actually implement so many our ideas just with a few prompts. Some people just think of vibe coding as putting in their crazy idea in the chat window and expects it to work perfectly.

The way to think of the number is to convert it into a base-26 number. Then we can map each digit into a character. Anyways, the better way is to use Trie.

If we only look at one element <code>k</code>, the answer would be <code>0</code> and <code>k</code>.

Then we can easily check if the <code>sum_of_all_element // 2</code> exists in the array. Using bit operation we can further improve the time complexity. The idea is as follows. If a sum <code>s</code> can be formed using all exists elements, we create a variable <code>bit_set</code> and mark <code>s</code>th bit to 1. When a new number <code>n</code> is introduced, we  can simply execute the operation <code>bit_set |= bit_set &lt;&lt; n</code>.

While the ubiquitous adoption is profounding, the lag of scaling up can't be ignored. No more than 10% of companies successfully scale up the agent system in any individual function. This suggests that the deployment of agent system is still stuck in the pilot phase. Companies are building agents that works around 80% of the time as a prototype. There is still a long way to go to bridge that gap between 80% to 99.9% reliability. Different industries have different altitude towards the agent system.
