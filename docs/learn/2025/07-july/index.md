As they say clarity is the biggest enemy against procrastination. So here are a more detailed version of my plans related to each topic.

### **Fall Recruitment Preparation**

In general, SDE candidates are tested from the following two aspects:

* Techinical 
* Behavior

For Technical Questions it basically falls into these categories:

* Leetcode questions
* Computer Science Basics
* System Design

So here is how they are gonna fit into my daily schedule:

- Complete two Leetcode Problems and redo the previous two (Focus on the real OA problems, and during the redo explain the thinking process, add more problems if we can finish all tasks in time)
- Find and solve real interview questions related to computer science basics. Review if the concept gets rusty
- For introduction finish the [system design interview book](https://bytes.usc.edu/~saty/courses/docs/data/SystemDesignInterview.pdf)
- Further study: [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems ](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321)

For Behavior Questions:

- Master STAR methods

### **Improve as an AI SDE**
