## üìù What I learned:

### Leetcode problem

[79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/description/?envType=company&envId=amazon&favoriteSlug=amazon-thirty-days)


#### Thinking Process

Another backtrack problem. Just iterate through all cells and perform a dfs search on each of them. If there is a match we return `True`. If none, we return `False`.

#### Key Takeaways

- Notice sometimes you can reuse the input 2D matrix as a visited matrix. Here you can mark any cell that you have visited as `#`. 
- Remember to restore the visited marker when you backtrack.

#### Complexity Analysis

Denote the number of cells as `n` and the length of word as `L`.

**Time Complexity: O(n*3^LL^)**
**Space Complexity: O(L)**

We iterate through all cells to perform a DFS. The DFS has at most 3^L^ calculation, since we have three direction to go at each level and there is L level at most. For the space, we only uses the recursion stack which has the same depth as the word.
