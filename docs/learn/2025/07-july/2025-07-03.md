## 📝 What I Learned

### Backpropagation Algorithm

- **Chain rule application**: How gradients flow backward through the network
- **Computational graph**: Visual representation of forward and backward passes
- **Key insight**: Each layer's gradients depend on the next layer's gradients

```python
def backprop(self, x, y):
    # Forward pass
    activations = [x]
    zs = []

    for b, w in zip(self.biases, self.weights):
        z = np.dot(w, activations[-1]) + b
        zs.append(z)
        activations.append(sigmoid(z))

    # Backward pass
    delta = self.cost_derivative(activations[-1], y) * sigmoid_prime(zs[-1])
    # ... rest of implementation
```

### Gradient Descent Variants

- **SGD**: Stochastic gradient descent - updates after each sample
- **Mini-batch**: Balance between efficiency and accuracy
- **Momentum**: Helps overcome local minima

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Gradient descent is like finding the steepest path down a mountain**
2. **Learning rate is crucial** - too high and you overshoot, too low and you're too slow
3. **Initialization matters** - Xavier/He initialization prevents vanishing gradients

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Implement different activation functions (ReLU, Leaky ReLU)
- Study regularization techniques (dropout, L1/L2)
- Build a CNN for image classification

## 🤔 Questions & Challenges

- Why does ReLU work better than sigmoid for deep networks?
- How to choose optimal learning rate automatically?
- What's the intuition behind batch normalization?
