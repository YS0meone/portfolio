## üéØ Daily Goals

- [x] Review Anki Deck
- [x] Lumosity training
- [x] Mailmind developing

## üìù What I learned:

### Where have I been:
It has been a week since my last log. I am still continuing my path as an AI engineerr but I find it quite hard to balance between studying through making flashcard on anki and creating content rich daily learning report. Usually, when I was making a lot of flashcards on a particular day, I was mainly learning techinical details like syntax, code patterns of certain library or language. These information does not fit well with the daily log media. It would look scattered and unorganized which I hate it. On the other hand, if I was reading a specific chapter of a book, a chapter summary would be a good log post. One of my bad habit is to have a great 'inertia' of doing things. When I was reading a book, I don't feel like developing projects that day and vice versa. I was learning quite a lot libraries these days that's why the log has been suspended for a while. I do want to get rid of this bad habit and I think writing furthers the depth of understanding. So I will try to make a daily post anyhow. (Maybe keep it minimal or just a summary)

To verify that the tech I am studying here actually have the market. I added the following section to keep track of current market requirement of an AI engineer. 

### üè≠ Industry Requirement:

#### [Abbott: AI Engineer/Architect](https://www.jobs.abbott/us/en/job/ABLAUS31099110ENUSEXTERNAL/AI-Engineer-Architect?utm_source=indeed&utm_medium=phenom-feeds)

#### Job Description:

* Integrate AI solution using LLM APIs ((OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Anthropic, Mistral))
* Shape LLM behavior through prompt engineering, guardrail development, and fine-tuning pipelines. 
* Design and build scalable APIs (e.g., FastAPI, Flask) to enable AI-driven features across products. 
* Lead performance tuning and ensure system scalability across mobile and cloud platforms. 
* Implement GenAI Safety Best Practices, focusing on hallucination mitigation and secure model usage. 
* Testing and Debugging‚Äî proficiency in AI app testing techniques, including unit testing, integration testing, and UI testing across various mobile devices and operating system platforms.  

#### Unfamiliar Concepts:

* Guardrail development: Practices that makes sure AI behaves ethically and responsibly.

* [AWS Bedrock:](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/bedrock/) provides API for AI application development. It's Amazon's answer to OpenAI, Azure OpenAI.
* [Mistral AI:](https://github.com/mistralai) It is a European based AI startup founded in 2023 based in Paris. It mainly focused on developing open source LLM targeting academic, enterprise and research audience.

#### Key Takeaways: 

In general, I seem to be working on the correct direction. The tech stack of Nextjs, FastAPI, Langchain is needed on the market. Besides development and deployment, the industry also values AI testing, monitoring and guardrail practice.
