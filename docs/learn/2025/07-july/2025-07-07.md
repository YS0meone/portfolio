## üìù New Learning System:

Instead of the regular learning drill, I did some optimization on my learning system. I am a big fan of the famous flashcard project anki. FSRS algorithm seems to be the shortest way towards long-term memory. It has helped me get through many quizzes and exams. Despite my love for it, I found myself struggling to create a proper code block in anki flashcard -- at least, I haven't found an easy way to do it. The code is not highlighted. Tab does not work properly in anki. There is no auto indentation. Just to name a few. 

After some research online, I finally find a workaround to use Obsidian with a anki converter plugin to solve this issue. Here is its tutorial.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PXyv6pnVGhA" 
            style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" 
            allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

Here is my end result:

### Obsidian View
I can create my deck through obsidian using neuracache flashcard style. And after I click the anki sync button to on the ribbon. All cards would be synced to the anki deck.

### Anki View

With this approach, I can enjoy the code highlight of the Obsidian and easily create fully styled flashcard on Anki.
